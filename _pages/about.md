I am a third-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Baoxiang Wang](https://bxiangwang.github.io/) in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). My primary research interests lie in **Reinforcement Learning** and **LLM Post-Training**, with a focus on RL-integrated applications.

Before joining CUHK-Shenzhen, I earned:
- My Master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Chun Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fYdxi2sAAAAJ) at **Tsinghua University**
- My **Bachelor of Engineering** from **Tianjin University**
- My **Bachelor of Economics** from **Nankai University**
